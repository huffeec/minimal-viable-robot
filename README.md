# minimum-viable-robot

A simple robot for Microbits using the Kitronik motor driver board and micro metal geared motors. 
It's intended as a way to introduce basic robotics in tech clubs and be a base for more adventurous projects.

Instructions for the code needed to use two microbits to remote control this robot can be found on the Liverpool Code Club site.
